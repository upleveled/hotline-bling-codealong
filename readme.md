# Hotline Bling Codealong

Simple demo showing how an Expo (React Native) app is built

## Tests

The test setup for this app showcases:

1. A managed Expo app
2. Detox end to end / integration tests
3. Gradle and XCode builds running on GitHub Actions (using `expo prebuild`)
4. Tests running on GitHub Actions using [the Android ATD emulator images](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/whats-new-in-scalable-automated-testing.html#:~:text=Slimmer%20Emulator%20System%20Images) and Simulator.app
